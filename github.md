# GitHub

In 2023, we use GitHub for selected parts of the assessment-related analyses.
Specifically, the analyses where we would like to:

1. Track **incremental development**. GitHub commits describe which changes were
   made when, why, and by whom. While working on complex analyses such as
   stepwise model development, this can be helpful to clarify the logic, reduce
   cognitive load, catch accidental errors, and guide the next steps in the
   exploratory analysis.

2. Strengthen **reproducibility**. Compared to traditional Penguin directories,
   GitHub repositories tend to contain *only the required files* and be *clearly
   organized*, representing an analysis that is more likely to *run on any
   machine*. Any team member can clone a copy of the repository on their laptop
   and check if the analysis runs.

3. Facilitate **collaboration**. GitHub provides tools and workflows to help
   team members work together on a specific analysis.

4. Strengthen **open science**. We can switch a specific analysis from private
   to public at an appropriate time, inviting PAW and SC to examine how things
   were done.

5. Automatically **backup**. This means we can explore or restore any previous
   state and there is no danger of things being accidentally deleted.

6. Guarantee an exact **identical archive** (clone) on Penguin of the work that
   was done, while enjoying the speed and efficiency of working on the laptop
   hard drive.
