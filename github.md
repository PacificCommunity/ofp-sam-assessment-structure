# GitHub

In 2023, we will explore which parts of the data preparation and
assessment-related analyses is practical to keep on GitHub.

GitHub is especially useful for parts where we would like to:

1. Strengthen **reproducibility**. Any team member can clone a copy of the
   repository on their laptop and check if the analysis runs.

2. Facilitate **collaboration**. GitHub provides tools and workflows to help
   team members work together on a specific analysis.

3. Strengthen **open science**. We can switch a specific analysis from private
   to public at an appropriate time, inviting PAW and SC to examine how things
   were done.

4. Automatic **backup**. This means we can explore or restore any previous state
   and there is no danger of things being accidentally deleted.
