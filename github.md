# GitHub

In 2023, we use GitHub for selected parts of the assessment-related analyses.
Specifically, the analyses where we would like to:

1. Track **incremental development**. GitHub commits describe which changes were
   made when, why, and by whom. While working on complex analyses such as
   stepwise model development, this can be helpful to clarify the logic, reduce
   cognitive load, catch accidental errors, and guide the next steps in the
   exploratory analysis.

2. Strengthen **reproducibility**. Any team member can clone a copy of the
   repository on their laptop and check if the analysis runs.

3. Facilitate **collaboration**. GitHub provides tools and workflows to help
   team members work together on a specific analysis.

4. Strengthen **open science**. We can switch a specific analysis from private
   to public at an appropriate time, inviting PAW and SC to examine how things
   were done.

5. Automatic **backup**. This means we can explore or restore any previous state
   and there is no danger of things being accidentally deleted.

6. Work on the laptop hard drive (fast), while guaranteeing that the Penguin
   archive has an exact **identical archive** (clone) of the work that was done.
