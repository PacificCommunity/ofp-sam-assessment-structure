# Score Card

## Introduction

SPC stock assessments are made available in two places: a full archive of the work done stored on the Penguin network drive, and a showcase analysis on GitHub that invites people to explore the main data and results.

For example, the 2023 BET and YFT assessment archives are found on Penguin at

```
z:/bet/2023
z:/yft/2023
```

and the showcase repos (public) are at

[ofp-sam-bet-2023-diagnostic](https://github.com/PacificCommunity/ofp-sam-bet-2023-diagnostic#readme)
[ofp-sam-bet-2023-grid](https://github.com/PacificCommunity/ofp-sam-bet-2023-grid#readme)
[ofp-sam-yft-2023-diagnostic](https://github.com/PacificCommunity/ofp-sam-yft-2023-diagnostic#readme)
[ofp-sam-yft-2023-grid](https://github.com/PacificCommunity/ofp-sam-yft-2023-grid#readme)

The Penguin archive is structured following the [SPC standard directory](https://github.com/PacificCommunity/ofp-sam-proper/blob/main/dir_tree.md#recommendation) structure and some of the subdirectories are cloned repos (private), such as

```
ofp-sam-yft-2023-assessment
ofp-sam-yft-2023-data-prep
ofp-sam-yft-2023-growth
