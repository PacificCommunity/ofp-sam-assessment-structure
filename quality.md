# Quality Assurance and Quality Control

**Quality assurance** is about organizing the work in a way that reduces the
probability of negative outcomes (lack of reproducibility, errors in analyses,
missing files, etc.).

**Quality control** is about developing and using a set of tools that can detect
when a negative outcome has occurred (lack of reproducibility, errors in
analyses, missing files, etc.) so it can be addressed and fixed.
