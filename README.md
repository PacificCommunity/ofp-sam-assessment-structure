# Ideas on how to organize SPC assessments

## New Style

In 2023, we will organize the assessments in directory trees on Penguin that
resembles how things have been done in the past. The subtle but important
changes are that:

- The directory tree will follow a **standardized naming scheme**. This makes it
  easier to find things and check which parts have been completed and properly
  parked.

- Some folders will be **GitHub repositories**.
