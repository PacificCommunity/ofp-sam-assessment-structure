# Ideas on how to organize SPC assessments

## Penguin and GitHub

In 2023, we will organize the assessments in directory trees on Penguin that
resembles how things have been done in the past. The subtle but important
changes are that:

- The directory tree will follow a **standardized naming scheme**. This makes it
  easier to find things and check which parts have been completed and properly
  parked.

- Some subdirectories will be **GitHub repositories**.

## GitHub

In 2023, we will explore which parts of the data preparation and
assessment-related analyses is practical to keep on GitHub.

GitHub is especially useful for parts where we would like to:

1. Strengthen **reproducibility**. Any team member can clone a copy of the
   repository on their laptop and check if the analysis runs.

2. Facilitate **collaboration**. GitHub provides tools and workflows to help
   team members work together on a specific analysis.

3. Strengthen **open science**. We can switch a specific analysis from private
   to public at an appropriate time, inviting PAW and SC to examine how things
   were done.

4. Automatic **backup**. This means we can explore or restore any previous state
   and there is no danger of things being accidentally deleted.
